# Python Course Lab Solutions

This repository contains my solutions for the Python programming course labs at Polytech Nice-Sophia. These solutions are implemented in **pure Python** (using only the Standard Library) to demonstrate foundational algorithmic thinking and object-oriented programming.

### 📂 Repository Structure

The labs progress from basic control flow and file I/O to advanced graph algorithms and custom data structures.

| Lab | Primary Topic | Featured Concepts & Exercises |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Lab 1** | **Foundations** | Unit conversion logic, quiz grading from CSVs, and recursive decision trees (animal guessing game). |
| **Lab 2** | **Graph Theory** | Graph representation using adjacency lists, connectivity checks, cycle detection, and Breadth-First Search (BFS). |
| **Lab 3** | **OOP & Classes** | Inheritance (Dates), custom properties (Oil Wells), and pathfinding robots using coordinate-based movement. |
| **Lab 4** | **Data Structures** | Custom Stack implementation, bracket balance checking, and iterative Depth-First Search (DFS). |

### 🚀 Getting Started

Since these solutions use **raw Python**, no external dependencies are required.

1. **Clone the repository:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/TFelbor/python-course-lab-solutions.git

```


2. **Navigate to a lab directory:**
```bash
cd Lab1_solutions
```


3. **Run a specific exercise:**
```bash
python3 lab1exercise1.py
```



### 🛠 Tech Stack

* **Language:** Python 3.x
* **Libraries:** None (Standard Library only)
* **Key Modules Used:** `random`, `enum`, `math`.
